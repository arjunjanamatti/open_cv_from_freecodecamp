    "In this assignment, you will work with k-nearest neighbors to classify wine quality using pandas, NumPy, and sklearn Python packages. You will use pandas to import the data set and convert the data into NumPy arrays to prepare it for classification using sklearn. You will then split the data set into a training data set and a test data set. From there, you will use sklearn to normalize the data sets, train the classifier, and use cross-validation to select the best k. Finally, you will evaluate the selected classifier using the test data set. \n",

Python concepts, instructions, and starter code are embedded within this Jupyter Notebook to help guide you as you progress through the assignment.

Upon completing the assignment, we encourage you to compare your work against the solution file to perform a self-assessment.\n",
